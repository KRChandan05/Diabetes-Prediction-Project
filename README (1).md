# Diabetes Prediction :
Diabetes is a chronic disease with the potential to cause a worldwide health care crisis.According to International Diabetes Federation 382 million people are living with diabetes across the whole world. By 2035, this will be doubled as 592 million. 
 
 Various traditional   methods,   based   on   physical   and   chemical   tests,   are   available   for   diagnosing diabetes.   However,   early   prediction   of   diabetes   is   quite   challenging   task   for   medical practitioners due to complex interdependence on various factors as diabetes affects humanorgans such as kidney, eye, heart, nerves, foot etc.
 
  Data science methods have the potential to benefit other scientific fields by shedding new light on common questions. One such task isto help make predictions on medical data. Machine learning is an emerging scientific field indata science dealing with the ways in which machines learn from experience. The aim of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques
